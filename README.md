# generateSecureMe

***Securing Passwords for everyone***
```
In this assignment we needed to make a password generator.
In this generator we need to make sure that certain characters were included for the user:

-Numbers
-upperCaseLetters
-lowerCaseLetters
-Special 

We then linked up a "Generate Button"
This button then generate a random password for the user
The CSS and HTML was already done for us. Our primary focus was rendering JavaScript
```
